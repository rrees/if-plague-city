# Main square

You remember the square as a place of bustle, noise and laughter. Few remain here and they are fearful, haunted, mad or all three.

Smoky unpleasant air haunts the square and the cobbles have not been cleaned in a long time.

Most of the grand buildings that surround the square are closed, many are even boarded shut. The one place whose doors remain open is the temple, candlelight is visible within it.

* Look at what the flea merchants are selling
* Talk to the townspeople
* Investigate the source of the smoke
