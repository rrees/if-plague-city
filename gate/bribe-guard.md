# The Gatehouse

The guard stiffens as you approach and clutches his spear tightly. There are no other travellers, no merchants making their way on the road, your approach and intent obvious.

"The city is closed, the plague is at work within. If you have any sense you'll turn back."

You stop at enough of a distance to be safely out of reach and slowly draw your purse from your belt.

Drawing forth two coins you remind the guard that you are returning to the city rather than entering and step forward.

The guard taps the ground in front of him with the spear and you drop the coins where indicated.

"I remember seeing you leave, I'm sure I'm not to keep residents out, just strangers." the guard says as they let you past and into the [main square](/main-square).

As you slip between the heavy doors you see the guard stoop to retrieve the coins.
