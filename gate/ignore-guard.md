# Entering the city

You walk up to the gate, matching the guard's stare. You can see the gate is open and you walk through.

The guard opens their mouth to protest but noting your grim demeanour and the blades at your side they choose not to confront you.

"I'd be doing you a favour if I did stop you." he calls after you "There's nothing but death in the city now".

You pass through the gatehouse and enter [the main square](/main-square).
