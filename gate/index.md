# The City Gate

The city is small enough that only one (official) entrance exists. With night not fallen the gate is still open and a single guard is present. They wear a steel helment, a studded jack and lean on spear.

They watch you approach with suspicion.

Do you:

* [Ignore the guard](ignore-guard)
* [Bribe the guard](bribe-guard)
* Talk to the guard
