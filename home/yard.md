# Home

You arrive at your house. It is quiet, there is no sign of life within nor any in the houses of your neighbours.

The fence and gate are in poor repair but are still present. You look over the fence hoping to see familar footprints in the mud of the yard. The rain has smooted the dirt flat, there is nothing.

You open the gate and enter. Everything is in good order, firewood stacked, the sheds have not been disturbed, the windows of the house are shuttered but there is no warning painted on it.

You feel you are the only living thing here. The thought is painful.
