# Returning home

The house is silent but everything is in good order. There is no sign of hurried departure nor that disaster has overtaken the household.

Clothes, food and utensils have been taken. 

 The surfaces have a thin layer of dust. You have arrived too late. Nothing can be done but hope remains. You think about potential refuges or havens that may have been considered.

 Weariness comes over you. You walk through the cold, empty rooms.

 You sit on the big family bed, someone has left clean sheets underneath the familiar quilted blanket made of the patches of so many familiar clothes and blankets from the past.

 You don't wish to dirty the clean cloth with the dirt of the road. You should relight the fire, draw some water and heat it the cauldron. The house should have it's domesticity rekindled.

 You drop your weapons and pack on the floor and free of their heavy burden you feel a jolt of fatigue. You close your eyes and cannot open them again. Your body sags under its own weight. When your head falls against the blanket you can smell familiar scents. There are many things you should do but sleep steals over you and darkness descends.

 You are home.
