# Going home

You walk through the familar narrow streets until the city opens up into the gardens and allotments that surround your own home. The vegetables and flowers thrive in their plots and their colours make a shocking contrast with the gloom of the city.

With the gardeners absent the plants have grown unruly, reaching for the sky and sneaking green fingers into the paths that are now more rarely used.
